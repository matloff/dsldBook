# Introduction and Motivating Examples

To set the stage, consider the following:

## UC Berkeley discrimination claims {#sec-ucb}

![ ](SatherGate.jpg){width=35%}

UC Berkeley was accused of discriminating against female applicants
for graduate school, and indeed the overall acceptance rate for women
was lower than that for men.  This seemed odd, given Berkeley's liberal
reputation.

However, upon breaking the data down [This data is included in R, as the
built-in dataset **UCBAdmissions**.]{.column-margin} according to the
program students were applying to, it was found that in every
department, the female acceptance rate *within that department* was
either higher than the male rate or of similar level.  The problem:
women were applying to more selective programs, causing their overall
rate to below that of men.

## US Census data {#sec-census}

![ ](USCensus.png){width=40%}

The **svcensus** dataset is a subset of US census data from back in 2000,
focusing on six engineering occupations.  [Included in the **dsld**
package.]{.column-margin} The question at hand is whether there is a
gender pay gap.  Again, the overall pay for men is higher, by about 25%.
But what if we break things down by occupation?  Though it does turn out
that some occupations pay more than others, and that men and women are
not distributed evenly among the occupations, there still is a gender
pay gap, of about 16%.

## Commonality

In both examples, we have an outcome variable Y of interest$\textemdash$acceptance
[As noted earlier, this book avoids technical definitions, keeping to
the intuitive, including our notion here of a confounder. Actually, a
fully precise definition is rather
[problematic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4276366/).]{.column-margin}
rate and wage income$\textemdash$and a sensitive variable S, which was gender in
both examples.  But in both cases, we were concerned that merely comparing
mean Y for each gender was an oversimplication, due to a possible
*confounder* C$\textemdash$department in the first example, occupation in the
second$\textemdash$ that is related to both variables.  Failure to take confounders (there can be more than one, and 
usually are so) into account can lead to spurious "relations" between S
and Y.

### Confounder adjustment analysis

So, in general, we wish to *estimate the impact* of a sensitive
variable S on an outcome variable Y, but *accounting for confounders* C.
Let's call such analysis "confounder adjustment."

:::

The above discussion summarizes the goal of Part I of this book.
Now contrast the above examples with a different kind, which will
concern Part II:

## COMPAS recidivism data

COMPAS is a commercial machine learning software tool for aiding judges
in sentencing defendants convicted of a crime.  The tool's main function
is to predict recidivism by a defendant. But a 2016 [*Pro Publica*
investigation](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)
found that the tool to be racially biased; African-American defendants
tended to be given harsher ratings$\textemdash$i.e. higher estimated
probabilities of recidivism$\textemdash$than similarly situated white
defendants.

Northpointe, the firm that developed COMPAS, [rejected the *Pro Publica*
analysis](https://www.equivant.com/response-to-propublica-demonstrating-accuracy-equity-and-predictive-parity/),
and we are not supporting either side here.  [Note that both *Pro
Publica*'s analysis and that of Northpointe used methodology like that
presented in this book.]{.column-margin} But if the COMPAS tool were in
fact biased, how could the analysis be fixed?  

A key point is that any remedy must not only avoid using race
directly, but must also minimize the impact of variables O that are
separate from race but still correlated with it, known as *proxies*.
If, say, educational attainment is correlated with race, the inclusion
of that variable in our analysis will mean that race is still playing a
role in our analysis after all. On the other hand, eliminating all
proxies may severely compromise our predictive ability.

### Fair ML analysis

Thus our goal is to *predict the outcome* variable Y, without 
using the sensitive variable S, while making only
limited use of the proxy variables O.

:::

## Summary:  the two kinds of discrimination analysis covered here

Note the difference between accounting for confounders on the one hand,
and fair ML on the other.  Here is a side-by-side comparison:

  aspect      confounder adjustment   fair ML
  ----------- ----------------------- ------------------------------------
  goal        estimate an effect      predict an outcome
  harm        comes from society      comes from an algorithm
  side info   adjust for confounders  limit impact of proxies 

Part I, on confounder adjustment, focuses on discrimination examples but
is applicable to confounder adjustment applications in general.  Part
II, on fair ML, is more specific to discrimination settings.

## Summary of symbols

The symbol X will at first denote all the variables other than Y and
S.  The general terminology is that Y is variously called the *outcome
variable*, *target variable* or *dependent variable*; the X variables
are known collectively as *covariates*, *features* or *independent
variables*.

Among the variables in X, we will separate out some to play the
role of C (Part I) or O (Part II), after which X will refer to all
variables other than Y, S, C and O.  

In terms of the above examples, here are the roles of the variables:


  example      Y            C                S        O
  ---------    ---------    -------          ---      ---
  UCB admits   acceptance   department       gender   \-
  Census       wage         e.g. occupation  gender   \-
  COMPAS       recidivate   \-               race     e.g. education


## A word before getting started

As noted, the book consists of two main topics:

* Part I, adjusting for confounders

* Part II, fair ML

So, let's get started.  One key point first, though:

### Notes on modeling, the role of the software, etc.

This book makes use of the **dsld** software, but is definitely not a
user manual for that package.  Instead, it is a guide to the statistical
principles, with the software playing a supporting role.

Any statistical model is approximate.  [The pioneering statistician
George Box famously said, "All models are wrong, but some are
useful."]{.column-margin}  And virtually any relation of interest in
practice is nonzero.  Modern statistical thinking places reduced
emphasis on significance tests and p-values, and asks instead whether A
has an effect on B that is substantial enough to be of interest.

A related point is that, unlike some readers may have experienced in
some statistics courses, real-world statistical analysis is not
conducted in a formulaic, "Step 1, Step 2,..." manner.  Instead,
decisions on say, which model to use, must be made by you, the analyst,
based on your overall assessment of the available information.  The
software cannot make your decisions for you.
