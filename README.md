*A Textbook* 


This book covers two major aspects of the use of data science in
discrimination contexts:

* **Part I:**  Assessing possible discrimination in observational
  contexts.

* **Part II:** Ameliorating discrimination in machine learning
  applications.

The book makes extensive use of the [dsld R
package](https://github.com/matloff/dsld), and is best read with access
to that software. However, its conceptual content is quite accessible
independently of that package.

The PDF of the book is [here]()https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/matloff/dsldBook/blob/main/_book/index.html.
