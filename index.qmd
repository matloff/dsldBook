Discrimination is a key social issue in the US and in a number of other
countries.  There is lots of available data with which one might
investigate possible discrimination.  But how might such investigations
be conducted?

Our **dsld** package provides both graphical and analytical tools
for this purpose.  It is widely applicable; here are just a few
use cases:

* Quantitative analysis in instruction and research in the social sciences.

* Corporate HR analysis and research.

* Litigation involving discrimination and related issues.

* Concerned citizenry. 

This book provides a tutorial regarding applicable methodology,
using **dsld** examples (though it is not a user manual for the
package).

## Prerequisite background

In addition to having rudimentary skill in R, the user should have a
very basic knowledge of statistical inference -- mean, variance,
confidence intervals and tests, and histograms.  A short, intuitive,
"bare bones" refresher, focused on confidence intervals, is given in
Appendix A.

Mathematical background, e.g. linear algebra, calculus and probability
theory, are **not** required, and concepts are explained via intuitive
language.

## The dsld package

The R package **dsld**, which this tutorial uses for examples, has two
[Python wrappers are included for many functions.]{.column-margin} 
aims:

* To enable exploratory analysis of possible discrimination effects
through various graphical and tabular functions.

* To enable formal statistical analysis of such effects via both
  enhanced access to general R functions such as **lm()** and **glm()**
  and various functions from the **qeML** machine learning package.
