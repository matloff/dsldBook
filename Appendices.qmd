## Appendix A: Standard Errors$\textemdash$Statistical Inference in a Nutshell

Say I wish to find the mean weight $\mu$ of all students at the University of
California, Davis.  It would be infeasible to measure them all, so I
take a random sample of 100 students.  The mean weight of those 100
students, denoted $\bar{X}$, is an estimate of $\mu$.

I know that $\bar{X}$ will have some unknown amount of error as an estimate of
$\mu$.  One measure of this is its *standard error* (SE).  What is this?

Remember, we took a random sample of students.  Different samples will
have different values of $\bar{X}$, i.e. $\bar{X}$ will have *sampling
variation*.  Then the SE of $\bar{X}$ is defined to be the standard
deviation of all possible $\bar{X}$ values, from all possible samples.
Of course, we only have one sample, so SE is unknown, but we can
estimate it.

The smaller the SE is, the more confident we are that the $\bar{X}$ from
[Meaning of that 95% probability figure: Think of all possible samples.
Each one has an $\bar{X}$ value, and an estimated SE value. So, each
possible sample, there is a different confidence interval (CI).  95% of
those CIs will contain the true $\mu$.]{.column-margin} our particular
sample is pretty accurate.  Of course, we can't be completely sure, but
we can quantify it probabilistically:

> $\bar{X}$, is $\bar{X} \pm 1.96 \times SE$.

The reader may have heard of the Central Limit Theorem, which says that
the sum of many random variables, itself a random variable, has an
approximately normal distribution.  This is the case for most classical
statistical estimators, such as estimated coefficients in linear and
generalized linear models.  Hence we can find confidence intervals as
above, taking the estimator plus and minus 1.96 times the SE of the
estimator.

CIs are generally taught together with *hypothesis testing* or
*significance testing*, which in many cases uses standard errors.  
@sec-sig reviews the notion, and discusses problems with this kind of
analysis.
